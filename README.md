This is my first Data analysis project which analyzes sales data from Amazon using Python and various data analysis libraries.
The goal of this project is to analyze -:
      A. Amazon sales data to uncover trends.
      B. Patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions.
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA),visualizations and statistical modeling to understand factors influencing sales performance.
